   [10]Version 0.2 released. Changes include: Update for IPv6 and newest
   glibc NSS interfaces

   Sat Nov 19 2005:

   [11]Version 0.1 released. Initial release.

Overview

   nss-myhostname is a plugin for the GNU Name Service Switch (NSS)
   functionality of the GNU C Library (glibc) providing host name
   resolution for the locally configured system hostname as returned by
   gethostname(2). A lot of software relies on that the local host name is
   resolvable via DNS to an IPv4 or IPv6 address. When using dynamic
   hostnames this is usually achieved by patching /etc/hosts which however
   is suboptimal since it requires a writable /etc file system and is
   fragile because the file might also be edited by the administrator.
   nss-myhostname simply returns the IPv4 address 127.0.0.2 (wich is on
   the local loopback) and the IPv6 address ::1 (which is the local host)
   for whatever system hostname is configured locally. Patching
   /etc/hostname is thus no longer necessary.

Current Status

   It works!

Documentation

   After compiling and installing nss-myhostname you'll find a new NSS
   modules in /lib:
     * libnss_myhostname.so.2

   To activate the NSS modules you have to edit /etc/nsswitch.conf and add
   myhostname to the line starting with "hosts:". On Debian this looks
   like this:
# /etc/nsswitch.conf

passwd:         compat
group:          compat
shadow:         compat

hosts:          files dns myhostname
networks:       files

protocols:      db files
services:       db files
ethers:         db files
rpc:            db files

netgroup:       nis

   That's it. You should now always be able to resolve your local system
   hostname. For a quick check use glibc's getent tool:
$ getent ahosts `hostname`
::1             STREAM omega
::1             DGRAM
::1             RAW
127.0.0.2       STREAM
127.0.0.2       DGRAM
127.0.0.2       RAW

   In this case the local host name is omega.

   It is recommended to put myhostname last in the nsswitch.conf line to
   make sure that this mapping is only used as fallback, and any DNS or
   /etc/hosts based mapping takes precedence.

Requirements

   nss-myhostname uses NSS interfaces that are specific to modern glibc's.

   nss-myhostname was developed and tested on Fedora 10 from October 2008,
   it should work on most other Linux distributions since it uses GNU
   autoconf and GNU libtool for source code configuration and shared
   library management.

Installation

   As this package is made with the GNU autotools you should run
   ./configure inside the distribution directory for configuring the
   source tree. After that you should run make for compilation and make
   install (as root) for installation of nss-myhostname.

Acknowledgements

   None so far.
